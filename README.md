# Open Sorts (open_sorts)
Sorting machine for TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering

## Overview

The Open Sorts sorting machine is designed to sort and potentially catalog cards for Magic: The Gathering.

It is constructed from Lego pieces and easily obtainable non-Lego components.

As of 3/13/2022, its sole functionality is sorting cards. There is, however, a clear path to a variety of other functions:

*   Cataloging cards to a CSV.
*   Documenting cards, possibly for resale or insurance purposes, saving images in the process.
*   Filtering cards by price, color, set, or some other critera.

It is my hope that with community contributions, the project can grow to have improved, expanded, and novel capabilities.

## Notices

### Safety

This machine uses electrical components including motors. It carries risks for fire, electrical shock, mechanical harm or other malfunctions.

*   Build and operate this machine at your own risk.
*   Never leave the machine unattended while plugged in.
*   Make sure the machine is unplugged and fully powered off before touching any electrical components.

### Damage to cards

This machine is designed to be used with collectible trading cards. Due to physical constraints, cards must be unsleeved when processed by the machine. Any time a trading card is touched, there is a risk that the card will be damaged or destroyed. Processing a card with a machine carries even more risks and modes of failure.

*   Use this machine on cards at your own risk.
*   No guarantee is made that the machine will not damage or destroy cards.
